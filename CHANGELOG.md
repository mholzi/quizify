# Changelog

All notable changes to Quizify are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Admin UI now follows your Home Assistant language.** The setup screen
  defaulted to German on first visit, so English speakers saw a flash of
  English that switched to German and stayed there with no obvious way back
  ([#152](https://github.com/mholzi/quizify/issues/152)). The admin interface
  now uses Home Assistant's configured language (Settings → General). Any
  non-German language (French, Spanish, …) falls back to English, since the UI
  ships in German and English only. The 🇩🇪/🇬🇧 toggle still switches the UI for
  the current session.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-07

The first official release of Quizify — a multiplayer trivia party game that
lives entirely inside Home Assistant. The TV is the host, phones are the
buzzers, and there's nothing to install for your guests.

### 🎉 Everything in 1.0.0

- **Scan and play.** The TV shows a QR code; everyone joins on their phone.
  No apps, no accounts, no logins. It all runs on your local network.
- **1,800 questions across 18 packs.** Nine themes — Geography, Animals &
  Nature, Pop Culture, Sport, Music, Science, History, Food & Drink, and
  Technology — each a clean 100 questions, in both German and English.
- **Pick your game.** Quick round, Classic, or Marathon presets, or go custom:
  choose your own topics, difficulty, round count, and timer.
- **Power-ups.** Joker, Double Points, Freeze, Steal, and a time boost turn a
  quiz into a party.
- **Streaks and bonuses.** Speed bonuses, difficulty multipliers, and streak
  fireworks at 3, 5, and 7 in a row.
- **A finale worth waiting for.** A podium, per-player superlatives, a
  highlights reel, and a full ranked leaderboard.
- **Soft Parlor design.** Warm cream paper, a four-color palette, and
  typography built to read across the room — cozy and friendly, like a family
  board game.
